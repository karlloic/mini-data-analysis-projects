# Exploratory Data Analysis projects

### 1. nyc_taxi_trips.ipynb - When is the best time to hit the road in NYC?
  In this mini project, I use data on approximately 2 million taxi trips in NYC taxi trip data to determine when it will be best to travel through the city, in other words, what does the traffic look like throughout the day. The data was obtained from TLC's website (NYC Taxi and Limousine Comission).
